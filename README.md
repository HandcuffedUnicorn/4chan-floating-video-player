    Install the Extension:
        Drag and Drop: Drag and drop the .xpi file directly onto the Add-ons Manager page.
        Manual Installation: Alternatively, click the gear icon in the top-right corner of the Add-ons Manager, and choose Install Add-on from File. Then, select the .xpi file from your system.

Usage

    Toggle Playback: Press Ctrl + Space to toggle the floating video player on and off. If the player is already open, pressing the hotkey will close it.
    Resize Player: Use the resize handle at the top-left corner of the player to adjust its size. Drag to resize it according to your preference.
    Playlist Navigation: Click on any video name in the playlist to jump to that video in the player. The currently playing video will be highlighted.
    Auto-play: Once a video ends, the player will automatically load and start the next video in the playlist.
    
=========================================
Known Issues

    Some websites may prevent the extension from accessing video URLs due to security restrictions.
    If the player becomes unresponsive, try refreshing the page and reopening the player.
    
    To be honest, this is just for 4 chan, supports webms and MP4s. I have no idea how it would work with other websites.
