4CHAN Floating Video Player - FIREFOX ONLY?

=========================================

A simple, customizable floating video player with a playlist for seamless video playback while browsing. This extension allows you to watch videos in a floating window while browsing other content, and it supports dynamic resizing, playlists, and hotkey controls.
Features

    Floating Video Player: Play videos in a customizable, floating player on top of your web content.
    Resizable Player: Drag the handle to resize the player to your preferred size.
    Playlist: View a list of clickable video names and navigate between videos easily.
    Hotkey Support: Toggle playback or open/close the player using Ctrl + Space.
    Auto-play Next Video: Automatically play the next video in the playlist once the current one finishes.
    Cross-Video Playback: Switch between videos in your playlist and continue playback seamlessly.

=========================================
Installation Using about:debugging in Firefox

If you're unable to install the extension via the regular about:addons page, you can use the about:debugging page to install it manually.
Step-by-Step Installation:

    Open Firefox:
        Launch Firefox and type about:debugging in the address bar, then press Enter.

    Load Temporary Add-on:
        Click the Load Temporary Add-on button.
        A file dialog will appear. Select your .xpi file from your system and click Open.

    Confirmation:
        Firefox will prompt you to confirm that you want to install the extension. Click Add to proceed.

    Extension Installed:
        The extension will now be installed temporarily in Firefox. It will remain active until you close Firefox or remove it manually via about:debugging.

    Using the Extension:
        Once the extension is installed, you can use it just like any other extension in your browser. However, note that temporary extensions installed through about:debugging will not persist after you restart Firefox.

=========================================
Usage

    Toggle Playback: Press Ctrl + Space to toggle the floating video player on and off. If the player is already open, pressing the hotkey will close it.
    Resize Player: Use the resize handle at the top-left corner of the player to adjust its size. Drag to resize it according to your preference.
    Playlist Navigation: Click on any video name in the playlist to jump to that video in the player. The currently playing video will be highlighted.
    Auto-play: Once a video ends, the player will automatically load and start the next video in the playlist.
    
=========================================
Known Issues

    Some websites may prevent the extension from accessing video URLs due to security restrictions.
    If the player becomes unresponsive, try refreshing the page and reopening the player.
    
    To be honest, this is just for 4 chan, supports webms and MP4s. I have no idea how it would work with other websites.
